# Fly.io Distributed Systems Challenge

This repo is my attempt at the [Fly.io "Gossip Glomers" distributed systems challenges](https://fly.io/dist-sys/). It's also a learning exercise for me to play with Go.

## Dev Container

Because I tend to switch between OSX and Windows machines, this repo uses a dev container. [VSCode setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). As part of its setup, the container will run the `make install` command. Other make commands are intended to be run by the user, inside the container.

To get started, just clone the project and open it in VSCode. Then from the "Open Remote Window" dialog select "Reopen in Container".
