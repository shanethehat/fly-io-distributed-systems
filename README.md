# Fly.io Distributed Systems Challenge

This repo is my attempt at the ![https://fly.io/dist-sys/](Fly.io "Gossip Glomers" distributed systems challenges). It's also a learning exercise for me to play with Go.

Becasue I tend to switch between OSX and Windows machines, it uses a dev container, which works very well with VSCode.
